# Amazon EKS on AWS Graviton

[AWS Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) processors are custom built by Amazon Web Services using 64-bit ARM Neoverse cores to deliver the best price performance for you cloud workloads running on Amazon EC2. The new general purpose (M6g), compute-optimized (C6g), and memory-optimized (R6g) instances deliver up to 40% better price/performance over comparable current generation x86-based instances for scale-out and Arm-based applications such as web servers, containerized microservices, caching fleets, and distributed data stores that are supported by the extensive Arm ecosystem. You can mix x86 and Arm based EC2 instances within a cluster, and easily evaluate Arm-based application in existing environments.

## Getting started
[Here](https://github.com/aws/aws-graviton-getting-started) is a github repository for a guide to getting started with AWS Graviton. You can find out more details about how to build, run and optimize your application for AWS Graviton processors.

## Download example
Download this example on your workspace
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Young-ook/terraform-aws-eks
cd terraform-aws-eks/examples/arm64
```

## Setup
[This](https://github.com/Young-ook/terraform-aws-eks/blob/main/examples/arm64/main.tf) is the example of terraform configuration file to create a managed EKS with ARM64 architecture based node groups on your AWS account. And also, it creates AWS CodeBuild project to build an application based on ARM64 architecture linux container. Check out and apply it using terraform command.

### CodeBuild Environment
To build an application for ARM64 architecture with AWS CodeBuild, we have to configure environment variable of the build project. The key parameters of the environment for build project are `image`, `type` and `compute type`. The image parameter is (container) image tag or image digest that identifies the Docker image to use for this build project. We use `aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-aarch64-standard:2.0` image to build an application for ARM64 architectuer based. The type of build environment to use for related builds. In this example, `ARM_CONTAINER` is suitalbe. Be aware of that the environment type `ARM_CONTAINER` is available only in regions US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and EU (Frankfurt). For more information about build project enviroment, please refer to [this user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-codebuild-project-environment.html)
There is another important configuration for build project. We have to set compute type to `BUILD_GENERAL1_LARGE` type. Currently it is only available for `ARM_CONTAINER` environment type of CodeBuild project. Please visit [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-compute-types.html) to find out more information and for latest updates.

Run terraform:
```sh
terraform init
terraform apply
```
Also you can use the `-var-file` option for customized paramters when you run the terraform plan/apply command.
```sh
terraform plan -var-file tc1.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file tc1.tfvars
```

## Verify
After provisioning of EKS cluster, you can describe nodes using kubectl and check out your node groups are running on ARM64 architecture.
```sh
kubectl describe node
```
```sh
System Info:
  OS Image:                   Amazon Linux 2
  Operating System:           linux
  Architecture:               arm64
  Container Runtime Version:  docker://19.3.6
  Kubelet Version:            v1.17.11-eks-xxxxyy
  Kube-Proxy Version:         v1.17.11-eks-xxxxyy
```

## Hybrid-Architecture node groups
Amazon EKS customers can now run production workloads using Arm-based instances including the recently launched Amazon EC2 M6g, C6g, and R6g instances powered by AWS Graviton2 processors. Create an EKS cluster with a mixed architecture based node groups. And run the command that you can see on the terraform output to get a kubeconfig file for cluster access. It should look like this: `bash -e .terraform/modules/eks/script/update-kubeconfig.sh -r us-west-2 -n eks-x86-arm64-tc2 -k kubeconfig`. For more detail of the script, please refer to the [Generate kubernetes config](https://github.com/Young-ook/terraform-aws-eks/blob/main/README.md#generate-kubernetes-config)

### Deploy NodeJS application from Private Registry
Apply the artifact from codebuild project for multi-arch container image build

```sh
kubectl apply -f hello-nodejs.yaml
```

### Deploy Nginx from Public Registry
Copy below and **SAVE** as a new deployment file (nginx.yaml) on your workspace. You can edit the file if you have anything to change.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nginx-svc
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: nginx
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
Then, apply the modified manifest.
```sh
kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
```
The output could be:
```
service/my-nginx-svc created
deployment.apps/my-nginx created
```

To verify that the nginx pods are running properly on the multiple architecture node groups, run describe command.
```sh
kubectl describe nodes
```
```sh

## Clean up
Remove application:
```sh
kubectl delete -f hello-nodejs.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl delete -f nginx.yaml
```

Run terraform:
```sh
terraform destroy
```
Don't forget you have to use the `-var-file` option when you run terraform destroy command to delete the aws resources created with extra variable files.
```sh
terraform destroy -var-file tc1.tfvars
```
