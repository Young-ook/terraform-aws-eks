# IAM Role for Service Account (IRSA)
## Setup
[This](https://github.com/Young-ook/terraform-aws-eks/blob/main/examples/irsa/main.tf) is the example of terraform configuration file to create a managed EKS on your AWS account. Check out and apply it using terraform command.

Run terraform:
```
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply
```
Also you can use the `-var-file` option for customized paramters when you run the terraform plan/apply command.
```
$ terraform plan -var-file default.tfvars
$ terraform apply -var-file default.tfvars
```

## IAM Role for Service Accounts
After then you will see the created EKS cluster and node groups. And also, you will see IAM role for Service Account resource. For more information about configuration of service account mapping for IAM role in Kubernetes, please refer to the [IRSA](https://github.com/Young-ook/terraform-aws-eks/blob/main/modules/iam-role-for-serviceaccount/)

## Clean up
Run terraform:
```
$ terraform destroy
```
Don't forget you have to use the `-var-file` option when you run terraform destroy command to delete the aws resources created with extra variable files.
```
$ terraform destroy -var-file default.tfvars
```
